# House Loan Eligibility Prediction

### Python Flask ML Application:
### Domain:
- **Finance and Banking**

### Context:
- Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customers first apply for a home loan after that company manually validates the customer eligibility for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling the details online. They need a web application where a user can access their website and register, login, and enter the required details such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others for checking the eligibility for the home loan.

### Project Objective:
1) This is a standard supervised classification task. A classification problem where we have to predict whether a customer is eligible for loan or not based on a given set of independent variable(s).
2) To build a Python Flask ML application where a user has to get registered by entering the username and password and login to the website and then enter their details to check whether they are eligible for loan or not.

### Dataset Description:
Dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ssiddharth408/loan-prediction-dataset

1. **Loan ID**: Unique Loan ID
2. **Gender**: Male or Female
3. **Married**: Applicant married (Y/N)
4. **Dependents**: Number of dependents

### Learning Outcomes:

1. **Supervised Classification**: Gain proficiency in supervised classification algorithms for predicting loan approval status.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Acquire skills to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilize EDA techniques to extract insights and understand the underlying patterns in the loan dataset.
4. **Flask Web Development**: Learn to develop a user registration, login, and data entry web application using Flask.
5. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Build a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
6. **Web Application Deployment**: Deploy the Flask ML application on a web server for real-time loan eligibility predictions.
7. **Collaborative Development**: Experience working collaboratively on version control platforms like Git for project management and code collaboration.
8. **Finance and Banking Domain Knowledge**: Develop insight into the factors influencing loan approval decisions, including credit history, income levels, and educational background, within the context of finance and banking operations.
